Consider the following program: 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main( void ) { 
 int *p1;  
 char *p2; 
 p2=p1;  
} 
 Will the program compile successfully without warnings? Why and why not? 


ANSWER:
No it won't. It will show warning because p1 points to int and p2 points to char so they are incompatible.
