start
declare int variables ppl,pag and float variable reams
reams= ((ppl+5)*pag)/500.0
(since we have to Assume the required number of pages will not equal an exact number of reams)
reams= reams+1
print ("the required no of reams are %.0f",reams)
exit


TEST CASE:
ppl = 25, pag = 140
reams = ((25 + 5) * 140) / 500.0
      = 4200 / 500 
      = 8.4
reams=8.4+1
     =9.4
since we are using %.0f it will print "9" in the output.
